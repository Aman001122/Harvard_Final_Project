## Features

- **Add Habits**: Users can input new habits to track their daily progress.
- **Log Habit Completion**: Users can log when they complete a habit, incrementing their progress.
- **Display Statistics**: The application provides a summary of each habit, showing how many days the habit has been completed versus the target days.
